## Description

The goal of this project is to provide ImmoEliza with the insights they need to establish themselves as the biggest real estate company in Belgium. By analyzing the data, I aim to answer questions related to the correlation between various variables and the property price, the most and least expensive municipalities in Belgium, and other related questions.

The project involves extensive data cleaning, data analysis using tools such as pandas, matplotlib and seaborn, and presenting the interpreted results using simple words and relevant visuals.
